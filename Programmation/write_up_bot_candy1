#IRC - Go back to college

IN this challenge, I must send a private message to bot Candy: "!ep1" and then it replies with something like this: <number1>/<number2>.
I must calculate the square root of the number n°1 and multiply the result by the number n°2.
I have no more than 2 seconds to send the correct answer to the bot from the time I send "ep1!".
Response must be like : !ep1 -rep <answer>

I coded a python IRC bot that connects to the channel required by the challenge that sends !ep1 to the bot, makes the equation and sends the correct answer.
