#IRC - Encoded string

IN this challenge, I must send a private message to bot Candy: "!ep2" and then it replies with a series of encoded characters in base64.
I must send him the decoded message.
I have no more than 2 seconds to send the correct answer to the bot from the time I send "ep2!".
Response must be like : !ep2 -rep <answer>

I coded a python IRC bot that connects to the channel required by the challenge that sends !ep2 to the bot, decode the message and sends the correct answer.
