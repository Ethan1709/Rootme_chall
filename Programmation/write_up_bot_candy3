#IRC - The Romanâ€™s wheel

IN this challenge, I must send a private message to bot Candy: "!ep3" and then it replies with an encoded string with ROT13.
I must send him the decoded message.
I have no more than 2 seconds to send the correct answer to the bot from the time I send "ep3!".
Response must be like : !ep3 -rep <answer>

I coded a python IRC bot that connects to the channel required by the challenge that sends !ep3 to the bot, decode the message and sends the correct answer.
