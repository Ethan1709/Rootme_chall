#Poem from Space

In this challenge, I needed to understand that the end of lines are full or white spaces(Whitespace language).
I coded a script in Python (main.py) that reads the poem and detects if there is a white space or tab and save it in the output.txt file.
Then you just copy past the content in output.txt in a white space decoder ti find the password.
